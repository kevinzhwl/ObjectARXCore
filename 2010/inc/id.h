    !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

        Text-filtering scripts process this file to extract the version
        information.  You should only change the values for the ACADV_*,
        ACADVFULL, and ACADVNUM macros.

        DO NOT MAKE OTHER CHANGES TO THIS FILE.

    The ACADV_* macros below have the following valid ranges. 
    They implement a specific naming convention (see R160BPLT1 for
    details).  Changing the naming convention will require changing
    IDVER.H, which depends on these ACADV_* values.
    (The ranges that include letters are case-sensitive.)

    !!! All numbers need to be expressed as decimal numbers.
        Not octal, 03, and not hexadecimal, 0x03.

    ACADV_RELMAJOR  a nonnegative number, e.g., 13, 14, 15.
    ACADV_RELMINOR  0 .. 9
    
    ACADV_BLDSTREAM A .. Z
    ACADV_BLDMAJOR  0 .. 9 .. 99
    ACADV_BLDMINOR  0 .. 9 .. 99
