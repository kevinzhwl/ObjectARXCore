//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrShell class is the interface class for brep shells. All the
// functionality supported by this class is implemented by the class
// AcBrImpShell.
//
// This class defines the functions that are pertinent to the shell
// level of a brep topology adjacency hierarchy, which is not exposed
// as a subentity type in AutoCAD and thus cannot be directly set by
// the user; it is set indirectly by the traversers. It is also used
// to set the first shell of a shell list in AcBrBrepShellTraverser. 
//
// Shells are secondary brep elements and thus have no associated
// geometry. Conceptually, a shell corresponds to a set of neighbouring
// surfaces on a solid. 
//
// The default constructor instantiates an empty object. The function
// isNull() returns kTrue on an object created this way. To set an
// AcBrShell, call AcBrBrepShellTraverser::getShell() or AcBrFace::
// getShell() using this shell object as input.
//
// The getComplex() upward adjacency query returns the complex that is
// bounded by this shell (always unique). The complex is instantiated by 
// the caller and passed by reference for getComplex() to set. If this
// shell object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is returned. If 
// the associated AutoCAD object has been modified since the subentity
// path was last set, eBrepChanged is returned. If the complex is missing,
// Acad::eNotInDatabase is returned. In the event of an error, the complex
// reference object is unchanged and is thus likely to be uninitialised.
//
// The getType() shell type query returns a dedicated ShellType enum which
// identifies this shell as being either kShellExterior or kShellInterior.
